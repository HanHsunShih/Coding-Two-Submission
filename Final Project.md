# Final Project
## concept
This project utilizes openframworks to generate particles upon the user pressing the space bar on the keyboard. The particles continue to generate as long as the space bar is held on and change colour with each key press. Over time, the particles transition in colour and fade away while also floating in the "z" direction due to the force settings. The perspective of particle system can be adjusted using the mouse, with zooming in and out possible by scrolling. The aim is to create the interaction fireworks effect that can be enjoyed at close range. The effect is designed to provide a virtually stunning scene that immerses the users within the sparkling particles. A force acting on the particles slightly changes the direction of their fall, adding to the user's sense of involvement. When view from above, the user feels as though they are among the firworks in the sky, or view from bottom, they feel as particles falling toward them.
